Write a script that will read the given CSV files and output the name and speed
of the 3 fastest horses, in order of fastest to slowest.

Use the following fictional speed formula:
Speed = (Leg Length * 2.5) * sqrt(Calories Per Meal) / (Age / Weight * 200)

General rules:
* Try to spend only <=1hr on this problem. It helps to know what you can complete in this timeframe.
* Please let me know if you need clarification, or feel free to state your assumptions in code comments.
* Use whichever language you feel most comfortable with, or that you feel is most suitable for the problem.
* If you know how to do an exercise with a bash one-liner then I'd love to know about it, but the point of
  the exercise is to demonstrate control of a scripting language (bash, python, etc).
* You should be free to use man pages, docs, Google where needed, but please no peer-programming. Be honest.
* Ideally you'd return this to us within 24 hours in an email reply, or linked from an email reply.
